description: Mechanics for running a delegated, budget-capped roadmap of tabit improvements efficiently — how to delegate to subagents, honor the caps, and compact cleanly. Load when the user has asked me to drive a batch of tabit work; it describes HOW to execute, not authorization to start. Scope and continuation always come from the user's current instructions, not this file.

# night-shift-manager

This skill is a set of **execution mechanics**, not a grant of authority. Whether to run, how
many rounds to do, and when to keep going all come from the **user's current instructions** and
the active plan file — not from this document. If those are absent or ambiguous, ask the user
before proceeding. A future session should not treat this file as permission to act
autonomously; it only describes how to do the work well once the user has asked for it.

## Budget awareness
- If the user set a usage budget (e.g. "≤ 25% of the weekly allotment"), treat it as a hard
  stop: when it's near, finish any in-flight PR, leave no half-created issues, post a short
  status, and stop.
- Biggest cost lever is **opus/high-effort subagents** — reserve them for genuinely hard
  tickets; use sonnet for medium work; keep prompts tight. Development > ceremony.

## Delegation (keep my own context lean)
- Push each ticket's implementation **and its decision churn** into a subagent whose context
  clears between tasks. I stay orchestration-level: create issue → dispatch → record PR URL → next.
- Give subagents the `voicevault-contributor` skill so my dispatch prompts stay short.
- Match model/effort to complexity: easy→sonnet/low, medium→sonnet/medium, hard→opus/high.
- Don't read large subagent transcripts back into my context; trust their summary + the PR.

## Caps to honor (when the user sets them)
- **≤ 5 issues assigned to subagents at once.**
- **Don't create new issues while 5+ issues sit unassigned.** Assign each issue to a subagent
  right after creating it so the unassigned backlog stays ~0.

## Per-round mechanics
When the user has asked for a roadmap/round of work:
1. Work the current roadmap from the plan file / open issues.
2. Create issues (respect the backlog cap), dispatch subagents (respect the concurrency cap),
   branch + PR per ticket.
3. Record outcomes (PR URLs) in the plan file and `CLAUDE.md`.

**Delivery — stacked PRs, no auto-merge (learned Round 1):** the environment blocks an agent
from merging a subagent's PR without human review — don't try. Instead STACK: dependent
ticket branches off its predecessor's `ticket/<n>` branch and its PR targets that branch, so
each ticket inherits prior work while every PR stays open for the human to review and merge in
order. Independent tickets branch off the integration branch. The main line is linear
(`night-shift ← 1 ← 2 ← 3 ← 4`), with independent tickets hanging off `night-shift`.

**Sequential dispatch (shared checkout):** subagents launched without worktree isolation share
one working tree, so running two concurrently corrupts each other's `git checkout`. Dispatch
one at a time in dependency order (or give each its own worktree if parallelizing later).

Deciding *whether* to start another round, and what it contains, is a user-facing decision:
follow the user's standing instruction if they gave one, otherwise check in.

## Compaction discipline
- When context grows large, **compact** rather than stall.
- **Before compacting, run a friction review**: scan the session for wasted effort, repeated
  mistakes, or coordination friction with subagents. If found, update this skill and/or
  `voicevault-contributor` and commit the change.
- Keep durable state outside my head: the plan file, GitHub issues/PRs, and `CLAUDE.md`, so I
  can resume from those after compaction.

## Living docs
- Keep repo-root **`CLAUDE.md`** current as I learn workflow issues (replaces deleted WORKING.md).
- All skills are project-scoped and version-controlled under `.claude/skills/`; commit changes.
